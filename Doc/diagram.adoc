As the main user of the application will be the tenants (see link:overview.adoc#users-roles[users roles]), we have identified several actions that the tenants will be able to do. 

The main use case of the application will then be to look for an apartment that the user of the app will rent for a long period of time. The user, during his/her research, will be able to indicate his/her preferences (for example, the user is looking for an apartment with a terrace) and to obtain a sorted list of apartments after filling all the criteria. The first apartment in the list will be the best match between the characteristics of the location and the user’s criteria. 

We can also imagine other general use case such as saving the user’s favourite apartments in a list and consult them or a chat functionality which will allow the users to talk with the manager and to ask questions about the apartments.

We decided to keep this use case diagram because despite the new role of the application (just tenant), this functionality is not important but still remains existing in the application for a secondary role

== Idea

WARNING: This section are linked with the link:idea.adoc[idea documentation]. In this sense, these are design ideas, which are not yet integrated into the application.

=== Profiles (link with `value function`)

Click link:idea.adoc#value-function[here] to see the documentation on the evolutions which revolves around profiles and value function

We want to change the form `AskOpinionForUtility`. We think that the actual form is not really optimum. These changes will be done in 2 steps. The first one is to create profiles with default values to help user to complete the form (see the sequence diagram below). The second step is to adapt the existing operations around each criteria and importance of these one depending on the profile. 

To specify the operation for the user, we designed a sequence diagram.  

We can see that the user launches the program. The program initializes a window with the criterion’s form. The user can select a predefined profile. In this case, the form will be automatically fill with values estimated by the program. After that, the user can customize the values before sending them. If the values do not have the good format, the user must modify his entries. When all datas have the good format, the application will display the GUI results containing apartments corresponding to the user’s criteria.
