[IMPORTANT]
====
We have detected that some themes prevent the proper functioning of papyrus (for example, transparent arrows). +
We noticed this bug with the link:https://www.genuitec.com/products/devstyle/[DevStyle theme] +

== Convention for naming packages (for papyrus)

* The name of a package must start with the type of diagram he contains (CD, UCD, ID) and should look like this: “TypeOfDiagram_Description”. +
The only exception is for the JavaIteration package as it may contain different type of diagram.tr
* When you create a new child such as a use case or a new class, the name of it should finish with “UC” if it is a use case, “CD” if it is for a class diagram or “I” for an interaction diagram.
