This file explains how the different application packages work

The actual program is divided in few packages:

toc::[]

== apartment

This is the most important package in the application

This part explains the model of an apartment and creation methods of apartments.

The creation of an apartment is done using a builder.

The `ApartmentFactory` class allows you to manage the creation of an apartment

=== Address generation for random apartment

This section deals with the generation of random apartments.

The challenge is then to generate addresses randomly as a function of latitude and longitude.

[NOTE]
====
Longitude and latitude are restricted in a geographic area.
====

You can see an implementation in `ApartmentFactory#getOnlineRandomAddress()`

.see detailed documentation on the risk of non-return

====
An API call has an average 20% chance of failing. Given this highprobability, we iterate the call until we get a correct result (a good address).
Furthermore, we cannot iterate endlessly, that is why the probability that this function will return an exception of type AddressApiException is 0.032%

Regarding the probability that the application contains an error, we launched a program three times which carried out: five generations of 500 addresses (7500 addresses in the end).

We got the following results :

**1st generation:**

For 2500 addresses, we retrieved 2 AddressApiException (i.e. RETRY>5)
We retrieved 2,498 addresses (500, 500, 500, 499, 499)
It took 3047 HTTP calls (611, 612, 631, 603, 589)

**2nd generation:**

For 2500 addresses, we retrieved 2 AddressApiException (i.e. RETRY>5)
We retrieved 2,498 addresses (499, 500, 499, 500, 500)
It took 3022 HTTP calls (596, 635, 601, 596, 593)

**3rd generation:**

For 2500 addresses, we retrieved 0 AddressApiException
We recovered 2,500 addresses (500, 500, 500, 500, 500)
It took 3031 HTTP calls (612, 627, 584, 589, 618)
In addition, of the 9100 real HTTP calls, the client never closed and no `ClientErrorException` was thrown

On a sample of 6000 calls (not counting RETRY), we then obtained 5996 addresses as well as 4 AddressApiException errors. +
Empirically, the probability that we get a possible failure of the application is around 0.0533%.

In this sense, this function is not intended to be at the heart of the program. This probability seems quite reliable. +
Plus, it importance to notice that `getRandomAddress()` calls  `getOnlineRandomAddress()` but return an apipa address incase an Exception is thrown.
====

Indeed, the logic is to generate a longitude/latitude as explained above. Then reverse the longitude and latitude using the link:https://geo.api.gouv.fr/adresse[government API] by calling a JSON parser

In order to solve the problem concerning the API used, we decided to carry out a benchmark to compare different solutions.

|====================

== distance

Yhe only class we can find in this package is used to calculate distance between 2 points of a map. +
We can use it with 2 modes:

- *Address Mode*: To build distance between 2 addresses given to the constructor. 
- *Coordinate Mode*:  To build distance from coordinate (type of the Google Maps dependency:  LatLng) 

== gui

All this package concerns the Graphical User Interface and all interactions with the user. +
It’s very important for this package to do minimum operations linked to the thoughts of the program and keep only his role of builder of the display for the user and to send all requests to the thought part of the code.

== iconDisplay

This package contains a class getting the logo of the application. +
This class is used by some of GUI package classes. +
We can imagine moving this class in the `utils` package. 

== localize 

Inside, we can find a class which allows the program to get *the location of* an address using GoogleMaps’ API. +
This class is used only in test part.

== readapartments 

The class which compose this package is `ReadApartmentsXMLFormat` and allows us to get an apartment form an XML file. We can imagine making this class an abstract and the operations static because we don’t have to keep in memory immediately treated data. +
Another improvement idea can be to move this class in the `utils` package. 

== toxmlproperties 

This package has a class called `XMLProperties` which allows us to export apartment’s informations in a XML file. +
We can also imagine moving it in the `utils` package. 

== utils

This package combines all functionality which can help all classes of the program. +
All classes, global logic method and helper class, are organized in this packages package. In fact, if we want to change well-known method (like a date comparator) to adapt it to our needs, we can do it here.

== valuefunction

This package includes thoughts about calculating the satisfaction of a property's criteria for a customer

The valueFunction package gathers all the functions which attribute a value to each apartment according to some criteria. +
The functions of this package are called by AskOpinionForUtilities class. Apartments are sorted by value to show the user the apartments which are the most likely to suit them.

* *`PartialValueFunction<T>` interface*
+
This interface attributes a subjective value to a parameter. This is interface extends the class Function<T, Double> which transform the generic type in input to a double: see link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Function.html[here]
+
This interface uses a getSubjectiveValue(T objectiveData) method and can throws an IllegalArgumentException. objectiveData is the parameter on which we want to get the subjective value between 0 and 1.

* *`ApartmentValueFunction` class*
+
This class create an object `ApartmentValueFunction` from the different classes in the package. Every criterion, such as the number of bedrooms, the presence of a terrace or the TV, etc., is associated to a value and a weight. +
The default value for the criterion is 0 and its default weight is 0.1. At the end, the ApartmentValueFunction method returns the value of the apartment, that is the weighted sum of all criterion value divided by the sum of all weight. It’s a basic weighted average. 

* *`LinearValueFunction` class & `ReversedLinearValueFunction` class* 
+
The tricky part is that you can’t ask the user to attribute a value between 0 and 1. +
As we saw, `AskOpinionForUtilities` only ask the user how many bedrooms he desires or the surface he would like to have. The `LinearValueFunction` class transforms a number (for example 5 bedrooms) into a value between 0 and 1 using linear interpolation
+
`ReversedLinearValueFunction` is only used for the minimal number of nights. `LinearValueFunction` is for the floor area and the price per night. 

* *`BooleanValueFunction` class*
+
`AskOpinionForUtilities` asks the user if he wants the WiFi, a TV or a terrace. According to the user responses, `BooleanValueFunction` attributes the value 1 if the user wants this 0 else.

We could find a way to simplify the attribution of a value to an apartment because every time we use `AskOpinionForUtilities`, the value of each apartment is once again calculated. +
Maybe we could also lighten the `ApartmentValueFunction` which is very long and redundant. +
Improving our way to calculate the “value” of an apartment according to criteria could be improved to propose the user better apartments.

The class ApartmentValueFunction has 20 attributes: 10 of them represent the objects used to compute the subjective value of every attribute of the Apartment class and the 10 others are the weight of these attributes.

The subjective value of an attribute (for example the floor area) is a number between 0 and 1 which gives the position of a criterion in the referential interval. +
In order to compute it, we need to give an objective value to the algorithm. +
If this value is below the referential interval, the subjective value will be 0, indicating that the criteria in a certain apartment will not match at all the user preferences. +
If this value is above the referential interval, the subjective value will be 1, indicating that the criteria in a certain apartment match perfectly or is better than expected by the user. +
The more the value is close to 1, the better the value is. For the Boolean attributes, the only possible values are 0 and 1.

To compute the subjective value, a few objects had been defined by the former team: BooleanValueFunction, LinearValueFunction, ConstantValueFunction and ReversedLinearValueFunction. +
By default, in ApartmentValueFunction, we use the ConstantValueFunction object, which sets all the subjective value to 0. +
But, if we want to be more rigorous, we should define a Builder in ApartmentValueFunction in order to initialize more specifically the objects used to compute the valueFunction. +
Here is a tab which gives which object can be used for a criterion and why.

[width="100%",options="header"]
|====================
| Object | Criterion associated | Why | How is the subjective value computed? 
| LinearValueFunction | floorArea, floorAreaTerrace, nbBathrooms, nbBedrooms, nbSleeping | The value of this criterion can be associated with a linear function. For example, the more surface we have, the better it is. A big house will often satisfy more the user than a tiny apartment. So, these are the criteria for which the more we have, the higher will be the value. | o compute the subjective value, we first need an objective data and to initialize the object with a range of value (to create an interval). +
Then we have 3 cases: +
* Objective value < min of the range. Then subjective value = 0;
* Objective value > max of the range. Then subjective value = 1;
* Else: subjective value = (min – objective data)/(max – min)
| ReversedLinearValueFunction | pricePerNight, nbMinNight | These are the criteria for which the less we have, the better it is. +
For example, for the price, the cheaper it is, the best the apartment is for us. Same for the minimum nights to stay, it is less restrictive to have a small number of mandatory nights to stay than the contrary. | To compute the subjective value, we first need an objective data and to initialize the object with a range of value (to create an interval). +
Then we have 3 cases: +
* Objective value < min of the range. Then subjective value = 1;
* Objective value > max of the range. Then subjective value = 0;
* Else: subjective value = 1 - (min – objective data)/(max – min)
| BooleanValueFunction | Tele, wifi, terrace | Here are the criteria for which we can't associate a value. We cannot say this apartment has half a tele for example. We only have two choices: the element is whether present or absent (so the value is 1 or 0) | To compute the subjective value, we first need a Boolean which will be our objective data. We also need to initialize a map. Then we just look into the map whether the value associated to our objective data is true or false
|====================

The weight of an attribute is the importance given by the user to a certain aspect of the apartment. +
The higher the weight is, the more this criterion is important. It allows us to choose between two apartments as we know what the user “wants” more: a terrace or a wireless connection? With this weight, we can know how much a criterion is important and choose an apartment according to his or her priorities. +
By default, in ApartmentValueFunction constructors, all the weights are set to 0,1. A good idea can be to add in a Builder a section to set the weight according to the profile selected (we will detail this later).

To compute the subjective value of an apartment, you then must multiply each attribute subjective value with its weight. Then you sum all the results obtained and divide the result by the sum of each attribute weight.
